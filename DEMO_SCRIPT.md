# Pilot Demo Script: "The Resilience Alpha"
**Target Audience**: SCF Portfolio Manager (LBBW / Commerzbank)
**Goal**: Demonstrate the 15% Risk Reduction in a 10,000-point Shock Scenario.

## 🕒 0:00 - The Setup (The "Dark Correlation" Hook)
"Hi, I'm showing you the current portfolio for a Tier-1 Automotive chain. We have €Direct 50M allocated across 20 suppliers. On paper, our classical MILP solver (Gurobi) says we are 100% efficient with a 12% yield."

## 🕒 0:30 - The Stress Test (The "Black Swan")
"Now, we apply a 'Taiwan-Lite' shock: a 30-day logistics freeze in the APAC region. Watch the Classical Portfolio on the left. The yield remains 12%, but the **Principal at Risk** (Tail Risk) spikes to 45%. Why? Because the MILP model ignores the fact that 60% of our suppliers share a single sub-tier logistics hub."

## 🕒 1:15 - The Quantum-Inspired Correction (The "How It Works")
"Now, we switch to our **Topology-Aware R-QAOA Engine**. Notice how it identifies the 'Dark Correlation.' It automatically rebalances €4.5M from the high-yield APAC nodes to 'Systemically Orthogonal' suppliers in Eastern Europe. The yield drops slightly to 11.2%, but look at the resilience."

## 🕒 2:00 - The Ablation Proof (The "Bottom Line")
"Across 10,000 simulated shocks, the R-QAOA model saved **€13,823 per million** in principal losses compared to the classical solver. 
- **Classical Model Outcome**: Potential 15% principal destruction.
- **R-QAOA Model Outcome**: 4% principal destruction.
That is a **€7.2M protection delta** on a €500M portfolio."

## 🕒 2:30 - The Roadmap (The "Integration")
"This isn't just math. We are integrated with **PRISM Protocol** for LkSG compliance and have a roadmap for direct SAP Ariba hooks in Q2. We give you a production-ready dashboard that runs on sovereign EU infrastructure today."
