# The Quantum SCF Roadmap: From POC to Global Infrastructure

## Phase 1: High-Fidelity Validation (Next 3 Months)
*   **ERP Adapters**: Build read-only connectors for SAP S/4HANA to ingest real-time Payable data.
*   **Monte Carlo Verify**: Implement the multi-shot confidence scoring (currently partially implemented in the Digital Twin) as a core compliance feature.
*   **BaFin Sandbox**: Enter the German banking regulator (BaFin) innovation hub to discuss the auditability of randomized quantum algorithms.

## Phase 2: Hybrid Scaling (6-12 Months)
*   **Asynchronous Solver Hub**: Move from synchronous API calls to a robust task queue (Celery/Redis).
*   **Proprietary QUBO Library**: Build a library of "Transfer Risk Ratios" specifically for manufacturing sectors (Automotive, Chem).
*   **Pilot Program**: €10k-€50k pilots with two mid-tier German manufacturers (€200M+ revenue).

## Phase 3: Total Capital Orchestration (1-3 Years)
*   **The "Quantum Credit Line"**: Integrate directly with neobanks to offer real-time, quantum-de-risked financing rates.
*   **Global Supply Graph**: Expand the solver to handle 10,000+ nodes, mapping systemic risks (like the Suez Canal blockage) directly into supplier interest rates.
