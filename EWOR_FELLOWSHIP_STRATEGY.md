# EWOR Fellowship: Technical & Strategic Edge

## 1. The "Truth" Audit (For Interviews)
**Q: Is this running on a real Quantum Computer?**
**A:** "We have a multi-provider architecture with live adapters for IBM (Ehningen), D-Wave, and PlanQK. For this demonstration, we use our **Digital Twin Engine (Quantum-Inspired Annealing)** to provide instant results. This is a strategic choice: real Quantum QPU queues are currently too slow for real-time banking dashboards, but our logic is 1:1 compatible with the hardware when the customer moves to batch-processing."

## 2. Why this is an EWOR-level Business
*   **Combinatorial Explosion**: SCF managers currently use 'Weighted Average' risk. In a 500-supplier chain, the number of correlated failure paths is astronomical. Classical solvers (PuLP) fail here. We solve it.
*   **Capital Efficiency**: A 1-2% improvement in yield across a €500M supply chain is €5M-€10M in pure profit for the customer.
*   **Sovereignty**: By using PlanQK and IBM Ehningen, we satisfy the "Data Sovereignty" requirement that prevents EU banks from using US-only solutions.

## 3. The "Unfair Advantage"
*   **The Stack**: Hexagonal architecture (Domain-Driven Design) makes the app "Hardware Agnostic." If a new superior Quantum Chip is released tomorrow, we swap one adapter and we are live.
*   **Validation**: Benchmarked against real-world bankruptcy signatures from the UCI Manufacturing dataset.
