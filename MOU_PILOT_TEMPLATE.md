# Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) Template: SCF Resilience Pilot
**Parties**: [Berlin AI Labs / Quantum SCF] and [Partner Financial Institution / LBBW]

## 1. Objective
To evaluate the "Resilience Alpha" of the Topology-Aware R-QAOA optimization engine using anonymized, historical supply chain finance data from the Partner's Mittelstand portfolio.

## 2. Pilot Scope
- **Data Ingestion**: Partner provides historical data for 20-50 anonymized supplier nodes (Spend, Region, Tier-2 dependency).
- **Optimization Benchmark**: [Quantum SCF] will run an ablation study comparing the Partner's current MILP/Heuristic allocation against the R-QAOA output.
- **Stress Scenarios**: Mapping the portfolio against 3 specific shock vectors: 
    1. APAC Logistics Black-out.
    2. EU Energy price surge (>300%).
    3. LkSG Compliance failure contagion.

## 3. Success Metrics
- **Risk Neutralization**: A target of >10% reduction in Expected Shortfall (ES) during shock scenarios.
- **Principal Protection**: Verification of capital preservation delta > €1M per €100M allocated.
- **Integration Feasibility**: Validation of the REST API's ability to ingest Partner data formats.

## 4. Resource Committment
- **Berlin AI Labs**: Full access to the Simulation Engine (99.9% uptime), custom risk modeling, and a final "Resilience Audit Report."
- **Partner**: Dedicated Project Manager (2 hrs/week) and access to anonymized historical data sets.

## 5. Timeline
- **Week 1-2**: Data mapping & Anonymization.
- **Week 3-4**: Simulation & Stress-testing.
- **Week 5**: Presentation of results & ROI Business Case.

## 6. Intellectual Property & Confidentiality
- All Partner data remains strictly private and anonymized.
- [Berlin AI Labs] retains IP for the underlying R-QAOA engine and topological pruning logic.
