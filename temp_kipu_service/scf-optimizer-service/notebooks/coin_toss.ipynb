    "You probably used the PLANQK CLI to bootstrap this project ... and that's a great way!\n",
    "This Jupyter Notebook shows you the fastest way to run a quantum program using PLANQK.\n",
    "Just follow the steps below and you will be able to run your first quantum program in no time.\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, create a PLANQK account at <https://platform.planqk.de>.\n",
    "Skip this step if you already have an account.\n",
    "Next, log-in to PLANQK and copy your personal access token from the \"Home\" page to your clipboard.\n",
    "However, the recommended way is to [log-in](https://docs.platform.planqk.de/cli-reference.html#authentication) with the PLANQK CLI.\n",
    "Then you can use the `PlanqkQuantumProvider` without any further configuration."
